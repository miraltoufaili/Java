To improve the efficiency, we tend to add two important fields.  
* Keep track of the length of the list  
* Keep a reference to the back of the list  
  
    
##Adding to a list  
There are **only two ways** to change the contents of a list:  
* Change the value of **front**, i.e changing the starting point  
* Change the value of **variable.next** (current!!), i.e changing one of the current links of the list.  
  
  We have to stop *one position** early, i.e we need to position current to the final element!  

* Always remember to deal with the empty list condition
